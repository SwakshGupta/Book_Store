....................Here i am going to write about Promises async/await................

1. A Promise is a JavaScript object used for managing asynchronous operations.

2. . We can use them to convert asynchronous tasks into synchronous ones.

3. Promises enable the handling of data that is not currently available but will be available in the future.

4. Promises transition from the “Pending” state to either “Fulfilled” or “Rejected” once the asynchronous operation is completed. These states help manage the flow of asynchronous code and handle its outcomes

5. .then() method is use to handle the promise 


  ................

6. async function indicate that the result of the function is Promise and await wait for the promise to be resolve when the function is completed

7. for eg-

  async function ()=>
  {
    await User.getelementbyid(id)
  }

  here get element by id is a async function which will return us a promise so our javascript will wait till this function is executed



8. when we fetch any data from the database we use async await method which means fetching data is a asynchronous operation which will return 

us a promise promise will later be fullfilled or rejected if fullfilled then we can get the get the data using .then method
